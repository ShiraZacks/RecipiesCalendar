Instructions:<br/>
Prepare the Dough<br/>
1) Using a mixer with a dough hook, knead flour, yeast, sugar, sour cream, milk, egg, butter, brandy, and salt at low-medium speed for 10–12 minutes until smooth dough forms.<br/>
2) Cover bowl and let rise one to two hours until doubled in size.<br/>
3) Transfer dough to work surface and divide into 20–25 equal pieces.<br/>
4) Roll each piece of dough into a tight ball and place on a pan lined with well-greased baking paper.<br/>
5) Grease tops of balls and let rise one hour or until puffy.<br/><br/>

To Fry<br/>
1) Heat oil in a medium-sized pot to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). If you don't have a thermometer, test the oil by inserting a wooden spoon. If small bubbles form around it, oil is hot enough.<br/>
2) Fry donuts in hot oil until golden on all sides.<br/>
3) Remove donuts from oil with slatted spoon. Drain on plate lined with absorbent paper. Let donuts cool to room temperature.<br/><br/>

Prepare the Chocolate Cream<br/>
1) Put one cup (250 milliliters) heavy cream and chocolate squares into a medium-sized bowl. Melt in microwave or double boiler until completely melted and smooth.<br/>
2) Refrigerate ganache for one to two hours or until completely cool.<br/>
3) Transfer cold ganache to mixer bowl and add remaining half cup (125 milliliters) heavy cream. <br/>
4) Beat on high speed until very stiff, smooth cream forms.<br/><br/>

Fill the Donuts<br/>
1) Transfer chocolate cream to pastry bag with a smooth, half-inch (one-centimeter) tip. Fill donuts with a generous amount of cream.<br/><br/>

Prepare the Chocolate Icing<br/>
1) Break chocolate into squares and melt in microwave or double boiler. When completely melted, add oil and mix.<br/>
2) Transfer chocolate mixture to pastry bag (without a tip), and drizzle thin stripes on donuts.<br/><br/>

Prepare the Whipped Cream<br/>
1) Beat heavy cream and confectioners' sugar in mixer until very stiff.<br/>
2) Transfer to pastry bag with half-an-inch to one-inch (one- to two-centimeter) serrated tip, and pipe small mounds on top of donuts.<br/><br/>

Garnish with a little grated chocolate and serve. Donuts are best the day they're made.<br/>
